<h2> Simon Game </h2>

<p>This a very simple Simon game that I created in my spare time to test my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery skills.</p>

<p><strong>The rules of the game are :</strong></p>
<p> - Click on the title to start.</p>
<p> - The goal is to follow color patterns.</p>
<p> - The game will add one color at each level.</p> 
<p> - Repeat all the previous colors, until the current level you're in, by pressing the same color buttons, in order.</p>
<p> - After failing a sequence, click on the title to restart.</p>
