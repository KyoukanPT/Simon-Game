<h2> Simon Game </h2>

<p>This a very simple Simon game that I created in my spare time to test my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery skills.</p>

<strong>The rules of the game are :</strong>
<br>
- Click on the title to start.
- The goal is to follow color patterns
- The game will add one color at each level. 
- Repeat all the previous colors, until the current level you're in, by pressing the same color buttons, in order.
- After failing a sequence, click on the title to restart.
