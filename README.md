<h2> Simon Game </h2>

<p>This a very simple simon game that I created in my spare time to test my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery skills.</p>

<strong>The rules of the game are :</strong>
<br>
- Press any keyboard button to start. If you try to click with the mouse it will fail.
- The goal is to follow color patterns
- The game will add one color at each level. Repeat all the previous colors, until the current level you're in, by pressing the same color buttons, in order.
- After failing a sequence, press any keyboard button to restart.

<strong><em>Ps: Play this game on Desktop/Laptop only.</em></strong>
